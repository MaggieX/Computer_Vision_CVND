# Facial Keypoint Detection

## Project Overview
In this project, computer vision techniques and deep learning architectures are used to build a facial keypoint detection system. 
Facial keypoints include points around the eyes, nose, and mouth on a face and are used in many applications. 
These applications include: facial tracking, facial pose recognition, facial filters, and emotion recognition. 
The completed project can look at any image, detect faces, and predict the locations of facial keypoints on each face.

## Content
The project will be broken up into a few main parts in four Python notebooks, only Notebooks 2 and 3 (and the models.py file) will be graded:

#### Notebook 1 : Loading and Visualizing the Facial Keypoint Data

#### Notebook 2 : Defining and Training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to Predict Facial Keypoints

#### Notebook 3 : Facial Keypoint Detection Using Haar Cascades and your Trained CNN

#### Notebook 4 : Fun Filters and Keypoint Uses
